# **SYNTAX CHECKER**
## **End-to-End CI/CD DevOps Project**

---

## **Project Overview**

The **Syntax Checker** is a containerized web application deployed using a complete **CI/CD DevOps pipeline**.  
This project demonstrates how an application moves from **source code to a running service** using industry-standard DevOps tools and AWS cloud services.

The primary focus of this project is **DevOps engineering**, including automation, containerization, deployment, and troubleshooting real-world issues.

---

## **Project Objectives**

- Build a CI/CD pipeline from scratch.
- Automate build and deployment using Jenkins.
- Containerize the application using Docker.
- Deploy and run the application on AWS EC2.
- Integrate AWS RDS (MySQL) for data storage.
- Handle real production challenges (disk space, permissions, dependency conflicts).

---

## **How the Project Works**

### **1. Source Code Management**
- Application source code is stored in GitHub.
- Repository contains:
  - Application code.
  - Dockerfile for containerization.
  - Jenkinsfile for CI/CD automation.

---

### **2. Continuous Integration (Jenkins)**
- Jenkins is installed on an AWS EC2 instance.
- Jenkins pulls the latest code from GitHub.
- Pipeline is defined using a Declarative Jenkinsfile.

**Pipeline Responsibilities**
- Fetch source code.
- Build Docker image.
- Deploy Docker container.

---

### **3. Containerized Build (Docker)**
- Application is built entirely inside Docker.
- `npm install` and `npm run build` are executed during image creation.
- Dependency conflicts are handled at the Docker layer.
- Ensures consistent builds across environments.

---

### **4. Continuous Deployment**
- Jenkins deploys the Docker container on EC2.
- Existing containers are replaced during redeployment.
- Application runs on port **3000**.

---

### **5. Runtime Behavior**
- Users submit code via the UI.
- Backend API processes syntax validation.
- Data is stored in AWS RDS (MySQL).
- Usage duration is recorded for each request.

---

## **Project Execution Steps**

This section explains how to provision infrastructure and deploy the **Syntax Checker** application using **Terraform, AWS EC2,cloudwatch,RDS, Jenkins, and Docker**.

---

## **Step 1: Install Terraform and Provision Infrastructure**

Terraform is used to provision the required AWS infrastructure.  
Navigate to the `infrastructure/` directory and execute the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
---

## **Step 2: Connect to the AWS EC2 Instance and install my sql**

After the infrastructure is successfully created:

Open the AWS Management Console.

Navigate to EC2 → Instances.

Select the newly created EC2 instance.

Connect to the instance using SSH.

 install my sql:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-client -y

```
---
## **Step 3: Clone the Project Repository**

Once connected to the EC2 instance, clone the GitHub repository:

git clone https://github.com/anjan816/syntax-checker.git

cd syntax-checker


---
## **Step 4: Install Required Tools**

Install the necessary tools inside the EC2 instance:

Docker.

Jenkins.

Ensure that:

Docker service is running.

Jenkins is installed and accessible.

---

## **Step 5: Configure Jenkins Pipeline**

Open Jenkins in a browser:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:8080


Create a new Pipeline job.

Configure the pipeline with the following details:

Git Repository URL:

https://github.com/anjan816/syntax-checker.git


Branch->main.

Script Path->Jenkinsfile.

Save the configuration and click Build Now.

Jenkins will automatically:

Pull the source code and Build the Docker image

Deploy the application container.

---
## **Step 6: Access the Application**

After the Jenkins pipeline completes successfully, open a new browser tab and visit:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000

The Syntax Checker application should now be running.

---
## **Steps to Check AWS RDS (MySQL)**

This section explains how to verify that the AWS RDS instance is running correctly and how to access it from an EC2 instance.

---

## **Step 1: Verify RDS Instance Status**

1. Open the **AWS Management Console**
2. Navigate to **RDS → Databases**
3. Select your RDS instance
4. Ensure the **Status** is:

## **Step 2: Check RDS Configuration**

From the RDS instance details page, verify:
- **Engine**: MySQL
- **Endpoint**: `<rds-endpoint>.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com`
- **Port**: `3306`
- **DB Name**: `syntaxdb` (or your configured database)

---
## **Step 3: Verify Security Group Rules**

Ensure the RDS security group allows inbound traffic:

- **Type**: MySQL/Aurora
- **Port**: `3306`
- **Source**:
- EC2 security group (recommended), or
- EC2 private IP / VPC CIDR

This allows the EC2 instance to connect to RDS.

---
## **Step 4: Connect to EC2 Instance**

SSH into the EC2 instance where the application is running:

```bash
ssh -i <key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>

```

## **Step 5: Connect to RDS from EC2**

Use the RDS endpoint to connect:
```
mysql -h <RDS_ENDPOINT> -u <DB_USERNAME> -p


Enter the database password when prompted.
```
---
## **Step 6: Verify Database and Tables**

Once connected to MySQL:
```
SHOW DATABASES;
USE syntaxdb;
SHOW TABLES;

```
Expected tables:
```
syntax_requests
usage_time
```

---

## **Step 7: Check Data Insertion**

Verify records are being stored:
```
SELECT * FROM syntax_requests;
SELECT * FROM usage_time;
```

If records are present, the RDS connection is working correctly.

---

## **Key Configuration Files**

| File | Description |
|----|------------|
| Dockerfile | Defines container build and runtime |
| Jenkinsfile | CI/CD pipeline definition |
| package.json | Dependency management |
| infrastructure/ | Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) |
